# ABSTRACT: Manage installation and migration of an application's (Postgres) database



=pod

=head1 NAME

Pg::DatabaseManager - Manage installation and migration of an application's (Postgres) database

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Pg::DatabaseManager;

  Pg::DatabaseManager->new_with_options()->update_or_install_db();

or subclass it ...

  package MyApp::DatabaseManager;

  use Moose;

  extends 'Pg::DatabaseManager';

  has '+app_name' => ( default => 'MyApp' );

  has '+contrib_files => ( default => [ 'citext.sql' ] );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides an object which can be used to drop, create, and migrate
an application's Postgres database.

It uses L<MooseX::Getopt> so that it can be invoked easily from a command-line
script, but it is also designed to be usable from another module.

=head1 THE VERSION TABLE

In order to perform migrations, your application database must define a table
to store the database version. By default, this class expects this table to be
named "Version", but you can override this by setting the appropriate
attribute.

However, the structure of the table is fixed, and must look like this:

  CREATE TABLE "Version" (
      version  INTEGER  PRIMARY KEY
  );

This table should never contain more than one row (for obvious reasons).

You must include the version table in your database SQL DDL file.

You must I<also> include a single line which inserts the current database
version into this table:

  INSERT INTO "Version" (version) VALUES (6);

This class will parse the database SQL file to find this line in order to
determine the current database version.

=head1 MIGRATIONS

Migrations are defined in their own directory. That directory in turn contains
one directory per database version (except version 1). The per-version
directories should each contain one or more files. The files will be executed
in the order that Perl's C<sort> returns them. You can number them
(F<01-do-x.sql>, F<02-do-y.sql>) to ensure a clear ordering.

The files can either contain SQL or Perl code. Any file ending in ".sql" is
assumed to contain SQL (duh) and is executed using the F<psql> utility.

Otherwise, the file should contain Perl code which defines an anonymous
subroutine. That subroutine will be called with the C<Pg::DatabaseManager>
object as its only argument.

Allowing Perl migration files lets you do things like import contrib SQL files
as part of a migration, for example:

  {
      use strict;
      use warnings;

      return sub {
          my $manager = shift;
          $manager->import_contrib_file('citext.sql');
      };
  }

This is the entire migration file.

=head2 Testing Migrations

See the L<Pg::DatabaseManager::TestMigrations> module for a tool which you can
use to test your migrations as part of your test suite.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 Pg::DatabaseManager->new( ... )

This method accepts the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * db_name

The name of the database that this object will work with. Required.

=item * app_name

The name of the application that this database is for. This is only used in
informational messages. It defaults to the same value as C<db_name>.

It cannot be set from the command line.

=item * db_owner

The name of the database owner, which will be used when the database is
created. Optional.

=item * db_encoding

The encoding to use when the database is created. Optional.

=item * username

=item * password

=item * host

=item * port

These are connection parameters to be used when dropping, creating, or
modifying the database. All parameters are optional.

Note that the username will be used as the database owner if it is provided
but C<db_owner> is not.

=item * ssl

If this is true, then connecting to the database server will require an SSL
connection.

=item * sql_file

The SQL file that contains the DDL to create the database.

This file I<must not> contain C<DROP DATABASE> or C<CREATE DATABASE>
statements. Those actions will be taken care of by this code. Required.

=item * contrib_files

This is an array reference of contrib file I<names> like F<citext.sql> or
F<pgxml.sql>. These files will be loaded after creating the database, but
before running the DDL in the C<sql_file>. Optional.

=item * version_table

The name of the table which contains the database version. See L</THE VERSION
TABLE> for details. Defaults to "Version">

=item * migrations_dir

The directory which contains migrations for the database. This is required,
but the directory can be empty. However, if the database needs to be migrated
from one version to another, it expects to find migrations for every
appropriate version in this directory.

=item * drop

If this is true, then the database will be dropped and then recreated.

=item * quiet

Setting this to true suppresses any output from this module.

=back

=head2 $manager->update_or_install_db()

This is the one public "do it" method. It will update or install the database
as needed. If the drop parameter was true, then it will drop any existing
database first, meaning it will always install a new database from scratch.

This method tests whether it can connect to the database server's template1
database, and dies if it cannot connect.

=head2 $manager->import_contrib_file( $file )

Given a contrib file name such as "citext.sql" or "pgxml.sql", this method
finds the file and imports it into the database. If it cannot find the named
file, it dies.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

This module is designed to be subclassed. In particular, it may make sense for
a subclass to provide defaults for various attributes. Please see
C<Silki::DatabaseManager> in the L<Silki> distribution's F<inc> dir for an
example.

In future versions of this module, I plan to document more of the internals as
a stable subclassing interface. For now, if you subclass this module, please
let me know what parts of the interface you overrode.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-pg-databasemanager@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.  I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be
notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

=head1 DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.

Please note that B<I am not suggesting that you must do this> in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time, which seems unlikely at best.

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
button on this page: L<http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs-donation.html>
